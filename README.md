# About

Hi you, Noora here! I'm a software engineering student @ **Lahti University of Applied Sciences** and graduating in autumn 2019, if the planets align. I'm programmer with a strong design background.

## Game development

### The Last Stephen game demo

![The Last Stephen header](/images/robotheader.png "The Last Stephen demo")

* **Unity**
* **C#**

I took part in GameChangers BETA game development coaching [program](https://gcproject.fi/index.php/language/en/beta-coaching-program/) in the spring of 2019. The program consisted of theory lectures, networking and excursions to game studios among other things, while we developed a game idea into a working demo in multidisciplinary teams. We were a diverse team of designers, artists and writers while I was the programmer. This is the latest and largest of my projects. More info can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/Nooralogical/thelaststephen) that also contains the scripts for this game demo.

### Hotline LAMK GameMaker Studio 2 game

![Hotline LAMK header](/images/hotlineheader.png "Hotline LAMK game")

* **GameMaker Studio 2**
* **GameMaker Language**
* 2D graphics made with [Pixelart](https://www.pixilart.com) & **Adobe Photoshop CC**

This project was inspired by the Hotline Miami game, because we used the same game engine to create ours. Idea was to create a game where you would navigate Lahti UAS new campus building section, with computer labs and design workshops. You get study points for finding each classroom and finally graduate when you have enough points. Exactly like real life! The walking speed and point requirements can be adjusted.

I worked on some programming parts, mainly the UI. However I was responsible for the 2D graphics and animations as a whole. We worked in a team of 3 programmers so I decided to try my hand in things I rarely get to do.

### Finnish Game Jam 2018 game

![Robot's mission header](/images/robotheader.png "Robot's mission game")

* **Unity**
* **C#**
* 48 hours & 1 bag of crisps

I took part in the Finnish Game Jam in 2018, where me and my team designed and developed a game in 48 hours. The theme was Transmission and our team came up with a 2D platformer, where a robot is looking for his friend's body parts inside an abandoned factory. Idea was to utilize our sound designer as much as possible by adding unique sound for each part of the robot that will increase in volume when player approaces it. Otherwise the game play is simple platforming with an inventory for colletable items. 

I was both the lead programmer (the only programmer) and game/level designer for this game. Our team consisted of a sound designer, 2D artist, game designer, producer/scriptwriter and myself.

More details and all source codes can be found at the [Global Game Jam Game site](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/robots-mission).
