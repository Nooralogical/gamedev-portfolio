### Finnish Game Jam 2018 game

![Robot's mission header](/images/robotheader.png "Robot's mission game")

* **Unity**
* **C#**
* 48 hours & 1 bag of crisps

I took part in the Finnish Game Jam 2018, where we designed and developed a game during 48 hours. The year's theme was Transmission and our team came up with a 2D platformer, where a robot is looking for his friend's body parts inside an abandoned factory. Idea was to utilize our sound designer as much as possible by adding unique sounds for each part. I was both the lead programmer and game designer for this game. More details and all source codes can be found at the [Global Game Jam Game site](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/robots-mission).

### Hotline LAMK GameMaker Studio 2 game

![Hotline LAMK header](/images/hotlineheader.png "Hotline LAMK game")

* **GameMaker Studio 2**
* **GameMaker Language**
* 2D graphics made with [Pixelart](https://www.pixilart.com) & **Adobe Photoshop CC**

This project was inspired by the Hotline Miami game, because we used the same game engine to create ours. Idea was to create a game where you would navigate Lahti UAS new campus building section with computer labs and design workshops. You get study points for each classroom you find and finally graduate when you have enough points. Exactly like real life! 

I worked on some programming parts like the main menu, pause menu ja GUI elements. However I was mainly responsible for the 2D graphics and animations.
